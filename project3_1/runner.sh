# Answer question 1-6 by completing the bash commands inline.
# Standard output format will be given for each question, you must follow the format strictly.
# The colon ":" is a POSIX built-in basically equivalent to the "true" command, REPLACE it with your own command in each function.

# WARNING: Questions should be done using bash scripting only in this section. 
# Do NOT use other programming languages such as Java and Python, otherwise you will lose all the marks in this section.

# Question 1
# How many rows in million_songs_metadata.csv contain 'Aerosmith' (Case sensitive)?

# Note: You MUST use grep instead of awk for this question.
# Standard output format: <number>
answer_1() {
	grep 'Aerosmith' million_songs_metadata.csv | wc -l
}

# Question 2
# What is the total number of track_id(s) in million_songs_metadata.csv with
# artist_name containing "Bob Marley" (Case sensitive)?

# Note: You MUST use grep instead of awk for this question.
# It is quite challenging (but feasible) to just use grep without other bash commands
# You can also use cat, cut, wc, etc. piped with grep to make it easier
# Standard output format: <number>
answer_2() {
	cut -d ',' -f7 million_songs_metadata.csv | grep '.*Bob Marley.*' | wc -l
}

# Question 3
# How many rows in million_songs_metadata.csv contain 'The Beatles' (Case sensitive) on column 7?

# Note: q3 is the same as q2 in essence, so you SHOULD use awk this time.
# Standard output format: <number>
answer_3() {
	awk -v cnt=0 'BEGIN {FS=","}; $7~/.*The Beatles.*/ { print $7; };' million_songs_metadata.csv | wc -l
}

# Question 4
# Write commands to do the equivalent of the SQL query "SELECT AVG(duration) FROM songs;".

# Note: You can use either awk or grep for this question.
# Standard output format: <number>
answer_4() {
	 awk -v total=0 -v cnt=0 'BEGIN{FS=","}; {total+=$8; ++cnt;}; END{print total/cnt;}' million_songs_metadata.csv
}

# Question 5
# Merge the two original csv files into the file named `million_songs_metadata_and_sales.csv` in the current folder.

# Standard output format: No standard output needed
answer_5() {
	join -t ',' -j 1 -o '1.1,2.2,2.3,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,1.6,1.7,1.8,1.9,1.10,1.11' million_songs_metadata.csv million_songs_sales_data.csv >> million_songs_metadata_and_sales.csv
}

# Question 6
# Find the artist with maximum sales using the file million_songs_metadata_and_sales.csv.
# The output of your command(s) should be the artist name.

# Hint: Artists can have MANY different artist_names, but only ONE artist_id,
# which is unique to each artist. You should find the maximum sales based
# on artist_id, and return any of that artist_idâ€™s valid artist_name as the result.
# Any correct artist_name is fine to get the score

# Standard output format: <artist_name>
answer_6() {
